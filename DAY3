1.  The "type" attribute controls the behavior of an input element.
2.  The <select> element is used to create a drop-down box.
3.  The "type" attribute should be set to "submit" in order to send form data to a server.
4.  The <fieldset> element is used to group similar form items together.

1.  The border is the box that surrounds an element.  It separates the margin (space immediately outside the border) from the padding (space between the border and the element's content).
2.  For a CSS rule padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px; the top padding is 1 pixel, the right padding is 2 pixels, the bottom padding is 5 pixels and the left padding is 10 pixels.
3.  Block-level elements will always begin on a new line while inline elements sit within block-level elements and do not start a new line.
4.  Because fixed positioning is relative to the screen and not the rest of the page, it remains in the same position on the screen regardless of which part of the page you are viewing.  Z-index is important because in the case of overlap, it specifies which element is visible and which is covered by the other element.
5.  Fixed width content remains the same size (indicated in pixels), regardless of the size of the browser window.  Liquid layout content stretches and compacts as the browser window changes size.  Percentages are used in liquid layouts.
